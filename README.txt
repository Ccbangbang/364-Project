1.For the images which the cv2 can not detect both eyes. I can draw a pair of unappropriate glasses. (check static folder)
2.Works totally fine when the cv2 detect only one eye.
3.For Alex Quinn's homepage. Cv2 gives no eyes detecton. I can have the image with glasses in the static folder but my code for replacing the old url with new url does not work for alex's homepage. My code works for another professor's homepage which cv2 also can not detect the eyes.(https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3942)
4. Can not make links to absolute with homepages whoes html tags is in UPPER case. However, my code can save the modified picture of those homepages in static folder.(Can not display images for upper case homepages in Milestone 1)
5. I finished Milestone 1 and 2 on time.
6. The project took me about 40 hours to complete.
7. I know nothing about python, flask,html,css before taking 364.
8. Overall, if the homepage's image does not change or can not display, you can always check the static folder, the modified image should be there.
